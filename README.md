# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender

This project is a practice app for learning how to **connect to an external API** and **fetch data** from it.  
It uses **HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)** and a small **Express.js backend** that connects the frontend with the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

The app allows users to select their preferences (genre, language, mood, release year range) and then fetches recommended movies from TMDB.

## Features

- Choose a **genre**, **language**, **mood**, and release **year range**.
- Fetch movies from TMDB API based on these filters.
- Display results as styled movie cards (title, release date, language, overview, and poster image).
- Responsive design using plain CSS.
- Simple backend with **Node.js + Express** to handle API requests securely.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
